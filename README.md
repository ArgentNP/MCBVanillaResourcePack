- **Bees!**
    - Bees are cute, fuzzy, neutral mobs
    - Don’t hurt them, they don’t want to hurt you
    - Bees love pretty flowers and spend their lives gathering pollen from them
    - After gathering pollen, bees fly back to their nest
    - If a bee can't find pollen, it will return home
    - If a bee doesn’t have a home nest, it will wander around until it finds one it can use
    - Bees don’t like the rain and they sleep at night. They will return to their nest in these cases
- **Bee Nests and Beehives**
    - Bee Nests generate in Flower Forests, Plains, and Sunflower Plains biomes
    - When a bee visits a nest and completes its journey undisturbed, the level of honey increases

    - Campfire smoke calms bees - Place one underneath the nest or hive to keep them in chill mode
    - Redstone friendly! Dispensers can shear honeycombs from hives and nests
- **Honey Block**
    - Greatly reduces movement speed and jump height, but also reduces fall damage
    - You can “slide” down a wall of honey blocks to slow your fall (Parkour FTW!)
    - When a honey block is piston-moved, adjacent blocks also move
    - When a honey block is piston-moved, entities on top are moved along with it
- **Honeycomb Block**
    - A decorative block that can be crafted with Honeycomb
- **New Achievements**
